# About this repository
This is my personal starter boilerplate code I use when developing projects using Löve2D game engine (love2d.org)

# Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install packages using `npm install`
3. Run build in watch mode using `npm run build:watch`
4. Run Löve in debug mode using `lovec dist/.` which will also allow you to inspect logging into console

## Typescript To Lua
This boilerplate uses amazing project called TypescriptToLove (https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua) which makes writing games in Lua much more maintainable and friendly to developers who are used to web development (like me, who is coming from Angular background).

## Love Typescript Definitions
Kudos to @hazzard993 for creating complete TS typings for Löve. You can find those on https://github.com/hazzard993/love-typescript-definitions
